# Corona-Quiz-WebSite
Task 2 of ADG-VIT Learn Web Dev
This was given as a Task by ADG-VIT.

The task:

Make a dummy quiz portal and also a form that registers one for the quiz. 
The website that you make:

1: should have a form for name, email, phone number, username and password. And it should display appropriate messages according to the input (success for correct entry, or point out what's wrong).

2: should have a quiz with five questions and 4 options to each. The quiz should give each question a time of 1 minute. User should clearly see how much time they have left.

3: should have an end screen that has a screen for the marks obtained and an appropriate message and a button for re-test (which leads them to filling the form again).

P.S. My first Javascript Project
